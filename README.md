# FOOD-RECIPE-WEBSITE
This is a fully functional full stack food recipe website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The platform allows users to explore, filter, and search for a variety of recipes. Admin users can add, edit, and manage recipes through a dedicated admin panel.
